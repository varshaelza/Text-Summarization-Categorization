            "Error: I never thought it possible for me to agree with a single word uttered by Frederick Forsyth, but I'm in wholehearted agreement with him on this one.\n",
            "Error: We, as a nation are in grave danger of being duped by pro US propaganda, which of course also means we'll inherit most, if not all of their total paranoia, and allow our governments, of any political persuasion incidentally, to gradually, and insidiously, impose a police state by well tried & tested back door methods.\n",
            "Error: I grieve for the future of my children, it's no wonder they're adamant they don't ever want any of their own.\n",

            "Error: If individuals are treated in the same distorted way, then we've done ourselves more damage than any terrorist organisation could with bombs.\n",
            "Error: I agree in many ways with what Mr Forsyth has said - if we are to be respected and have influence within the world we must be seen to be walking the walk as well as talking the talk - how can we accuse countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma of human rights abuses when we are locking up people who may be totally innocent, it is hypocrisy of the highest order.\n",

            "Error: I accept that the intentions of these policies are to make Britain a safer place but I cannot think of a single example from history where doing this sort of thing has ever made any difference - in Northern Ireland internment certainly didn't achieve anything - the bombings didn't stop, and it could be argued that all it achieved was to just supply the IRA with yet more angry and resentful republicans willing to take up arms against the British.\n",
            "Error: Being eight years older than Frederick Forsyth and a survivor of the Blitz on London, it is easy to agree with him, he is absolutely spot on.\n",
            "Error: During the IRA bombings there were massive explosions in Canary Wharf, to the right of where I write this, and also to the left in the City of London.\n",
            "Error: Notwithstanding these and the attempted and nearly successful assassination attempts on Prime Minister Thatcher in Brighton and on later occupants of 10 Downing Street, there was no retaliatory blitz on Belfast or Dublin as there has been on Afghanistan and Iraq.\n",
            "Error: Even when England was in true peril in 1940 apart from some detentions there were no wholesale derogation of habeas corpus and the like.\n",

            "Error: Hence it is clear that the far too great police state powers set for the statute books have to be resisted and neutered.\n",
